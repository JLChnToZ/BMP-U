# [What is this repository for? ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/About)

In this repository is a collection of extension scripts / effects and controls to enhance your Unity UI experience. These scripts have been gathered from many sources, combined and improved over time.

> The majority of the scripts came from the Scripts thread on the [Unity UI forum here](http://bit.ly/UnityUIScriptsForumPost)

You can either download / fork this project to access the scripts, or you can also download these pre-compiled Unity Assets, chock full of goodness for each release:

# [Download](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/Downloads) - 2019.1 (aka 2.1)

We have expanded where you can download the UnityPackage asset and widened the options to contribute to the project.

> I will still stress however, ***contribution is optional***. **The asset / code will always remain FREE**

# [Updates:](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/ReleaseNotes/RELEASENOTES)

## Update 2019.1 - formally 2.1  - Going with the times

Given that it's been a while since the last release and a fair few number of fixes have been introduced since the last update, it's only fair I get this point release out for the masses.
This is only a point release and we are still working hard on the next full update

# [How do I get set up? ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/GettingStarted)

Either clone / download this repository to your machine and then copy the scripts in, or use the pre-packaged .UnityPackage for your version of Unity and import it as a custom package in to your project.

# [Contribution guidelines ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/ContributionGuidelines)

Got a script you want added? Then just fork the bitbucket repository and submit a PR.  All contributions accepted (including fixes)
Just ensure 
* The header of the script matches the standard used in all scripts
* The script uses the **Unity.UI.Extensions** namespace so they do not affect any other developments
* (optional) Add Component and Editor options where possible (editor options are in the Editor\UIExtensionsMenuOptions.cs file)

# [License ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/License)

All scripts conform to the BSD license and are free to use / distribute.  See the [LICENSE](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/License) file for more information 

# [Like what you see? ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/FurtherInfo)

All these scripts were put together for my latest book Unity3D UI Essentials
Check out the [page on my blog](http://bit.ly/Unity3DUIEssentials) for more details and learn all about the inner workings of the new Unity UI System.

# [The downloads ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/Downloads)

As this repo was created to support my new Unity UI Title ["Unity 3D UI Essentials"](http://bit.ly/Unity3DUIEssentials), in the downloads section you will find two custom assets (SpaceShip-DemoScene-Start.unitypackage and RollABallSample-Start.unitypackage).  These are just here as starter scenes for doing UI tasks in the book.

I will add more sample scenes for the UI examples in this repository and detail them above over time.

# [Previous Releases](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/Downloads)

* [Unity UI Extensions Unity 4.x Asset](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/downloads/UnityUIExtensions-4.x.unitypackage)

* [Unity UI Extensions Unity 5.1 Asset](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/downloads/UnityUIExtensions-5.1.unitypackage)

* [Unity UI Extensions Unity 5.2 Asset](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/downloads/UnityUIExtensions-5.2.unitypackage) <- 5.2.0 - 5.2.1 base releases ONLY

* [Unity UI Extensions Unity 5.3 (5.2.1P+) Asset](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/downloads/UnityUIExtensions-5.3.unitypackage) <- use this for 5.2.1P+ releases

> **Note** To retain 5.2 compatibility in the 5.3 package, you will see two warnings related to:
> ```
> `UnityEngine.UI.InputField.onValueChange' is obsolete.  
> ```
> This has no effect on the package working in 5.4 plus and is only there to maintain backwards compatibility.  We will look to update/remove this in a future release, likely after 5.4.  
If you have any concerns, feel free to update your code in your project to add the missing "d".  Unity have ensured it still works as they have mapped the API change for now.
